# When To Use Attestations
Attestations help us build more trustful interactions online. They can be used as credentials, forms of verifications, proof of something happening or not happening, ensure the integrity or authenticity of something, and much more. But when is the right time to use attestations via EAS?

## Existing Alternatives
As builders, I'm sure you've seen the surge in using NFTs and Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) for various types of attestations. Whether it's a credential being issued for access into a community or skill being achieved or other. These are simply just entities saying something about something or someone. But are NFTs and SBTs the best tools for the job? Or are we just defaulting to what we have available? What if there was something better?

:::warning Avoid the trap
"When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail." - Abraham Maslow
:::

NFTs revolutionized digital assets, but they falter when used as credentials due to their transferability and lack of interoperability. Enter SBTs, an upgrade with non-transferability and revocability. But even SBTs lack a universal standard. Each SBT is a unique contract with no consistent data structure, making integration a developer's nightmare. Let's stop trying to upgrade the "hammer" when you actually need a new tool altogether.

Is an NFT or an SBT the best solution, or is an attestation more apt?

## Devs
Frustrated with inconsistent digital signatures, non-interoperable platforms, and unreliable centralized databases? Attestations offer:
- **Unified Integration:** A standard for all verifications, cutting down on multiple API integrations.
- **Data Integrity:** Assurance that shared data remains untampered.
- **Interoperable Solutions:** Compatibility across platforms, dapps, and services.
- **Schema Registry:** A structured data approach for easy categorization and verification.

**Attestation Triggers:**
Integration, Data Consistency, Interoperability, Structure, Standardization, Compatibility, Security, Privacy

## Non-Technical Builders
Want a quick way to verify content, check member credibility, or ensure process compliance without centralized systems? Attestations can be your answer:
- **Content Verification:** Check the originality of content, from articles to reviews.
- **Community Trust:** Verify the authenticity of community members and their contributions.
- **Access Control:** Control access based on verified attributes.
- **Reputation Systems:** Create a reputation system where positive actions earn attestations.

**Trigger Words:**
Authenticity, Verification, Trustworthiness, Access Control, Reputation, Compliance, Credibility, Interoperability

## Users
Tired of repeatedly proving your identity or achievements on new platforms? Not sure who or what to trust online? Attestations can elevate your online journey:
- **Universal Recognition:** Use a single attestation across platforms.
- **Showcasing Achievements:** Display your achievements, from courses to community contributions.
- **Trust in Interactions:** Interact confidently, knowing others and/or content are verified.
- **Personal Control:** Choose who sees your attestations with offchain attestations, private data attestations, or zkps from attestation data.

**Attestation Triggers:**
Recognition, Achievements, Trust, Control, Verification, Privacy, Security
